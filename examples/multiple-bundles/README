Defining multiple bundles example. Take a look at gulpfile.js to see how multiple bundles are defined.

You'll notice one of these bundles is specified as an "sfx" (self-executing) bundle.
This will be output in globals format and does not require SystemJS to load.

To run the example app locally

    npm install
    tsd reinstall
