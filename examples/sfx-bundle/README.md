# Bundle-sfx example

This example is intended to show off the bundle-sfx (self-executing bundle) feature of jspm. That is, a bundle that had no dependency on SystemJS to load dependencies. One of these bundles can be included in a page and not need any other JS files available.

To run the example app locally

    npm install

    gulp
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000

    visit http://localhost:3000 to see the running app
